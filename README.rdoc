== Simple Settings

This gem exposes a Settings object for your Rails/Merb/Ruby apps. 
Attempts to load up "config/settings.yml" based on RAILS_ROOT or MERB_ROOT.
Otherwise, tries to load "settings.yml"

== Example

require 'rubygems'
require 'simple_settings'

Settings.xmpp = {:server => "localhost", :port => 5280}

puts Settings.xmpp.server
#=> "localhost"
puts Settings[:xmpp][:port]
#=> 5280
